## Code Guidelines

### Swift Style

- Follow Swift API Design Guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and small
- Prefer value types (structs/enums) over reference types where appropriate

### Architecture

- Use protocol-based abstractions for services
- Inject dependencies through constructors
- Keep UI logic in Views, business logic in Managers
- Use `Constants` for all magic numbers and strings

### Documentation

- Add documentation comments for public APIs
- Use `// MARK: -` to organize code sections
- Include license headers in all Swift files:
  ```swift
  //
  //  FileName.swift
  //  AgentMeter
  //
  //  Copyright (c) 2026 puq.ai. All rights reserved.
  //  Licensed under the MIT License. See LICENSE file.
  //
  ```

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Use mock implementations for protocol-based services
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR

## Pull Request Process

1. Create a feature branch from `main`:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes following the code guidelines

3. Run tests and ensure they pass:

   ```bash
   xcodebuild test -scheme AgentMeter
   ```

4. Build and verify the app works:

   ```

5. Commit your changes with clear commit messages:
